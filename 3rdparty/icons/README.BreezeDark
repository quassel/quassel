The icons found in the breeze-dark directory are a stripped version of the
Breeze Dark icon theme, part of KDE Frameworks, as found in KDE's git. We
have removed the parts of the theme we don't use in order to conserve space
in our own repository and to make downloads smaller.

The icons found here have been imported from:
https://github.com/KDE/breeze-icons
Commmit: bcee7b305a9c5ef1b2690b9d1cda19a2bcfb7957

We, the authors of Quassel IRC, do solely distribute this icon set (or parts
thereof), we are not involved in creating/editing/maintaining it. Please see
the appropriate files, in particular AUTHORS and COPYING, in the breeze-dark
directory. All icon files in this directory were copied verbatim and not
modified by us.

We would like to thank the Breeze team for creating such terrific artwork,
and we do hope that they see our use of their icon theme as a compliment :)
