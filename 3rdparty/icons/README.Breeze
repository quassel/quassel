The icons found in the breeze directory are a stripped version of the Breeze
icon theme, part of KDE Frameworks, as found in KDE's git. We have removed the
parts of the theme we don't use in order to conserve space in our own repository
and to make downloads smaller.

The icons found here have been imported from:
https://github.com/KDE/breeze-icons
Commmit: 28bc38f992dca31f11aa81b58adf980ea4bf3703

We, the authors of Quassel IRC, do solely distribute this icon set (or parts
thereof), we are not involved in creating/editing/maintaining it. Please see
the appropriate files, in particular AUTHORS and COPYING, in the breeze directory.
All icon files in this directory were copied verbatim and not modified by us.

We would like to thank the Breeze team for creating such terrific artwork,
and we do hope that they see our use of their icon theme as a compliment :)
