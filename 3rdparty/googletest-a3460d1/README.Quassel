We bundle the GTest sources because it is recommended to build the
libraries with the same settings as the program under test, and
most distros don't seem to provide the sources in their GTest package.

We ship the unmodified upstream sources, but we do remove a bunch of
unneeded directories (such as samples and build scripts).
