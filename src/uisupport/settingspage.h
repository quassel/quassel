//! A SettingsPage is a page in the settings dialog.
/** The SettingsDlg provides suitable standard buttons, such as Ok, Apply, Cancel, Restore Defaults and Reset.
 *  Some pages might also be used in standalone dialogs or other containers. A SettingsPage provides suitable
 *  slots and signals to allow interaction with the container.
 *
 *  A derived class needs to keep track of its changed state. Whenever a child widget changes, it needs to be
 *  compared to its value in permanent storage, and the changed state updated accordingly by calling setChangedState().
 *  For most standard widgets, SettingsPage can do this automatically if desired. Such a child widget needs to have
 *  a dynamic property \c settingsKey that maps to the key in the client configuration file. This key is appended
 *  to settingsKey(), which must be set to a non-null value in a derived class. If the widget's key starts with '/',
 *  its key is treated as a global path starting from the root, rather than from settingsKey().
 *  A second dynamic property \c defaultValue can be defined in child widgets as well.
 *
 *  For widgets requiring special ways for storing and saving, define the property settingsKey and leave it empty. In this
 *  case, the methods saveAutoWidgetValue() and loadAutoWidgetValue() will be called with the widget's objectName as parameter.
 *
 *  SettingsPage manages loading, saving, setting to default and setting the changed state for all automatic child widgets.
 *  Derived classes must be sure to call initAutoWidgets() *after* setupUi(); they also need to call the baseclass implementations
 *  of load(), save() and defaults() (preferably at the end of the derived function, since they call setChangedState(false)).
 *
 *  The following widgets can be handled for now:
 *    - QGroupBox (isChecked())
 *    - QAbstractButton (isChecked(), e.g. for QCheckBox and QRadioButton)
 *    - QLineEdit, QTextEdit (text())
 *    - QComboBox (currentIndex())
 *    - QSpinBox (value())
