/*
 * This is a little helper to display channel lists of a network.
 * The whole process is done in 3 steps:
 *  1.) the client requests to issue a LIST command with requestChannelList()
 *  2.) RPL_LIST fills on the core the list of available channels
 *      when RPL_LISTEND is received the clients will be informed, that they can pull the data
 *  3.) client pulls the data by calling requestChannelList again. receiving the data in receiveChannelList
