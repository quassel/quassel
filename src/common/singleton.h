 * Mixin class for "pseudo" singletons.

 * Classes inheriting from this mixin become "pseudo" singletons that can still be constructed
 * and destroyed in a controlled manner, but also gain an instance() method for static access.
 * This is very similar to the behavior of e.g. QCoreApplication.
 *
 * The mixin protects against multiple instantiation, use-before-instantiation and use-after-destruction
 * by aborting the program. This is intended to find lifetime issues during development; abort()
 * produces a backtrace that makes it easy to find the culprit.
 *
 * The Curiously Recurring Template Pattern (CRTP) is used for the mixin to be able to provide a
 * correctly typed instance pointer.
