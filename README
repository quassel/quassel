Quassel IRC - Release Notes
===========================

Please find the current release notes at <http://quassel-irc.org>.

On first run of the Quassel core, it will wait for a client to connect
and present a first-run wizard that will allow you to create the database
and one admin user for the core-side storage.  Note that Quassel does not
support the administration of user accounts yet, this includes adding
more users, changing passwords and so on.
However, you can add more users, or change passwords of existing ones,
using manageusers.py to be found in the scripts/ directory.

IRC is the preferred means of getting in touch with the developers.
The Quassel IRC Team can be contacted on Freenode/#quassel (or
#quassel.de).  We always welcome new users in our channels!

Our homepage is <http://quassel-irc.org>
The bugtracker can be found at <http://bugs.quassel-irc.org>
The dev team can be reached by email: <devel@quassel-irc.org>

Thanks for reading,
~ The Quassel IRC Team
