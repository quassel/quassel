# import_theme.pl

To update the packaged icon themes you use the import_theme.pl  
Check the top of the script for more detailed usage guide. But basically you need up to date copies of the complete icon themes (e.g. in your home folder) and then run this:
```
./import/import_theme.pl ~/oxygen-icons oxygen
./import/import_theme.pl ~/breeze-icons/icons breeze ICONS
./import/import_theme.pl ~/breeze-icons/icons-dark breezedark ICONS
```
Note: there are additional blacklist/whitelist files in the import folder used by this script
Please update the commit info in the theme's Readme on update.

# [quassel-icons](https://github.com/justjanne/quassel-icons)

The quassel-icons repository ([https://github.com/justjanne/quassel-icons](https://github.com/justjanne/quassel-icons)) by justjanne is used to generate the extra-icons folders (except the oxygen extra icons), the quassel icons in hicolor/ as well as the ico and icns in the pics folder (outside of this icons folder). It's also used for other quassel projects like Quasseldroid.  
To update, follow the guide there and copy the output into this repository.
