ChangeLog for Quassel IRC
=========================
This is not a full ChangeLog, but rather an end-user FeatureLog that is supposed
to provide a list of new features between Quassel versions. As such, it only
contains end-user visible, mostly major new features. It does not contain (most)
bugfixes, nor is it guaranteed to be complete or up-to-date at all. Also, it does
start at 0.3.0 only, since this was the first version widely available.

Please have a look at <http://bugs.quassel-irc.org/projects/quassel-irc/roadmap> for a
list of closed bug/feature reports (which still does not cover bugs we have
fixed but which were never reported, of course), and for a full list of
changes, the git history at <http://git.quassel-irc.org> is your friend.
