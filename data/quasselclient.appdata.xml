		<p>
Quassel IRC is a modern, cross-platform, distributed IRC client, meaning that
one (or multiple) client(s) can attach to and detach from a central core: much
like the popular combination of screen and a text-based IRC client such as
WeeChat, but graphical. In addition to this unique feature, we aim to bring a
pleasurable, comfortable chatting experience to all major platforms, making
communication with your peers not only convenient, but also available everywhere.
		</p>
		<p>
And the best of all: It's free - as in beer and as in speech.
		</p>
		<p>
This application is the client-only version of Quassel. You must first set up
(or have been given an account on) the quassel core before using this.
